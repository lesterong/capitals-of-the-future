  "aboutDescription": "We are inspired by the work of Pierre Nora on lieu de m√©moire (sites of memory) to understand their temporal counterpart, where some cities are imagined as instantiations of the future. In our research, we are examining greenfield urban sites of futuring that are rising as new capital cities (Nusantara), administrative centres (Putrajaya) and business and cultural hubs (Marina Bay, Jurong Industrial Estate, and Jurong Lake District in Singapore). This website documents our research explorations and beyond to other similar cities and districts that are being built or planned in Asia and the world.",
