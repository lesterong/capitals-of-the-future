This paper explores the proposed relocation of Indonesia’s capital city from Jakarta to Kalimantan. With its population of over 10 million, Jakarta faces environmental challenges such as severe traffic congestion and air pollution. This study used mixed methods and triangulation of data collection to investigate the capital’s relocation challenges and the prospects of the nations development. The methods include interviews with key informants in selected government agencies and non-governmental agencies, as well as content analysis of relevant secondary data and information. The results contribute to our understanding of the socioeconomic, political, and environmental impacts of relocating a capital city in an archipelagic country like Indonesia. The paper concludes that the proposed new capital’s location in Kalimantan offers a more sustainable alternative with the potential for economic growth and ecological preservation. It could serve as a symbol of national identity and a representation of the nation’s advancement.
