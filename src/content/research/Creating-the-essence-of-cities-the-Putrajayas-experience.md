The creation of a new Federal Government Administrative Centre at Putrajaya marks a new chapter in the development history of modern Malaysia. The development of this new administrative centre was prompted by the need to balance and disperse development to areas outside of Klang Valley. It is a decision motivated by the government's desire to improve the urban environment and quality of life, and to ease the pressure on the infrastructure in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley in general. In city planning terms, it provides a golden opportunity and a challenge to embark on something new and innovative representing Malaysian values and culture. Putrajaya the new Federal Government Administrative Centre, is to be equipped with the latest facilities and technologies for improved effectiveness and productivity, as well as, amenities that shall contribute to quality living and working environment. However the challenge also lies in fostering the spirit, sense of purpose and identity for the new city. This paper provides an insight to some of the basic principles and concepts behind the endeavor towards realizing this planning vision.
