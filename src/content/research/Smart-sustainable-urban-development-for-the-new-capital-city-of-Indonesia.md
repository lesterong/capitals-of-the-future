Research on the concept of Smart Sustainable Urban Development and its implementation is critical to support the urban future and urban governance. This research analyses the implementation of the smart sustainable urban development concept to support the urban future through the New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals, and urban governance in Nusantara Capital City, Indonesia. We collected data through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with the policy stakeholders and agencies relevant to the development plan of the city, supplemented with field surveys. The results show that the urban future from the national government is envisaged through six domain services encapsulating the sustainability and smart city elements. In the regional and local level, challenges are met including the environmental and social impact but through government collaboration and devising Information and Communication Technology, the authority has been able to design the solution. Sustainability, Information and Communication Technology, smart city, and urban governance constitute critical elements in the process of urban development, especially for the development of a new capital city.
